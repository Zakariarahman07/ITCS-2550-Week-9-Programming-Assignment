# Math Aptitude Analyzer

## Description

The **Math Aptitude Analyzer** is a C++ console application that evaluates a user's math skills and provides feedback to help improve them. The program collects user information, performs calculations, runs a math quiz, and generates formatted report files.

This project was created for **ITCS 2550 (C++ Programming 2)** and demonstrates core C++ programming concepts.

## Features

* Friendly welcome banner with console colors
* User input collection with validation
* Calculates estimated problems solved per hour
* 5-question math quiz with difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Instant quiz feedback based on confidence level
* Stores quiz scores in arrays and calculates averages
* Student report card builder using a class and array of objects
* Writes formatted output to text files

## C++ Concepts Demonstrated

* **Selection Statements**: `if / else`, `switch-case`
* **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`
* **Functions**: value-returning and void functions
* **Arrays**: storing test scores and student objects
* **Structs**: `LearnerProfile` for user data
* **Enumerations**: quiz difficulty levels
* **Classes & Objects**: `Student` class with constructors and member functions
* **File Handling**: writing data to `.txt` files using `ofstream`
* **Vectors**: use of vectors inside the class 'Student'
* **Binary Search, Sequential Search, Bubble Sort Algorithm Used**

## How to Run the Program

1. Open **Visual Studio** or **VS Code**
2. Make sure a C++ compiler is installed
3. Compile and run `main.cpp`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts
5. View generated output files:

   * `report.txt`
   * `StudentsReportCard.txt`
